Just get started...  
**git remote -v**  (view the full addresses of your configured remotes)  
cd into your new project directory  
**git init** (builds a .git directory that contains all the metadata and repository history)  
**git add .**  (instructs Git to begin tracking all files within and beneath the current directory)  
**git commit –m'This is the first commit'** (creates the permanent history of all files, with the -m option supplying a message alongside the history marker)  
  
Rename your old github repo ['master' branch to 'main'](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/OffensiveTechTerms.md)...  
```shell
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
```
