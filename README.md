### Cheat Sheets  
First and foremost: a couple **git cheat sheets** 
* [https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) 
* and TimGreen's list of git & github features -- with a table of resources and books at the bottom:
[https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet)
maybe also  
* Michael Gieson's git cheat cheet [https://www.gieson.com/Library/cheatsheets/md.html?git](https://www.gieson.com/Library/cheatsheets/md.html?git)  
* "The simple guide" [http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) 
and 
* [https://github.com/vineetpandey/github-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/vineetpandey/github-cheat-sheet)
and page 2 of 
* [http://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/) 
and documenation at 
[http://git-scm.com/docs](http://git-scm.com/docs)  
* Git Pocket Guide. By Richard E. Silverman [https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/git-pocket-guide/9781449327507/](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/git-pocket-guide/9781449327507/)  
* [Monorepos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) can hide a lot of different problems. [git-sizer](https://github.com/github/git-sizer) can help. git-sizer computes various size metrics for a local Git repository, flagging those that might cause you problems or inconvenience.  
* Finally, git repos may contain sensitive files and the scale of their history can slow pipeline activities. In some use cases [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) can help.


Just get started...  
**git remote -v**  (view the full addresses of your configured remotes)  
cd into your new project directory  
**git init** (builds a .git directory that contains all the metadata and repository history)  
**git add .**  (instructs Git to begin tracking all files within and beneath the current directory)  
**git commit –m'This is the first commit'** (creates the permanent history of all files, with the -m option supplying a message alongside the history marker)  
* or install Joel Parker Henderson's [GitAlias](https://www.gitalias.com/) and do the same more efficiently.  
  
Rename your old github repo ['master' branch to 'main'](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/OffensiveTechTerms.md)...  
```shell
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
```

* "The three fundamental Rules of Robotics" 
>**One**, a robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 
**Two**, a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 
**Three**, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.  [Isaac Asimov introduced these in his 1942 short story "Runaround" (*included in the 1950 collection I, Robot*) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics)]
